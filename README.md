# MVC: A Dataset for View-Invariant Clothing Retrieval and Attribute Prediction
by Kuan-Hsien Liu, Ting-Yen Chen, and Chu-Song Chen

## Introduction
We collect the MVC dataset by crawling images from several online shopping websites, such as Amazon.com, Zappos.com or Shopbop.com.   The challenge in constructing the dataset is to gather complete four different views (front, back, left, and right views) for each clothing item, as there may be only two or three views available for some clothes.

Here, we only provide 161,260 annoted images (1920 x 2240 resolutions) with 264 attribute labels.
(where the total images here are different to the paper.)

  * image_links.mat: image links
  * attribute_labels.mat: contains all image attributes labels (264 attributes)
